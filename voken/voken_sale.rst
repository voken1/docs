Gift for whitelist
------------------

Anyone who participate in the :ref:`voken2_sale`
by using a whitelisted ETH wallet address
would enjoy a gift of **BUY ONE AND GET ONE MORE FREE**.

- :ref:`how_to_join_the_whitelist`

For example
-----------

If you send **20 ETH** to the :ref:`voken2_sale_contract`
at the **7500th stage**,
and the **Audit ETH price** goes to **$200 USD** for example:

- This **20 ETH** will be treated as `$200 x20 ETH =` **$4,000 USD**.
- At the **7500th stage**,
  the exchange price is **$0.07600**,
  that is `$4000 / $0.07600 =` **52,631.578947 Voken2.0**.
- If your address is whitelisted,
  according to **BUY ONE AND GET ONE MORE FREE** privilege,
  you will receive a gift of **52,631.578947 Voken2.0**.

Finally, the amount is `52,631.578947 + 52,631.578947 =` **105,263.157894 Voken2.0**.

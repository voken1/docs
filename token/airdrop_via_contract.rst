VOKEN Airdrop via contract (Closed)
===================================

Total amount:
   50 Million Vokens

Per quantity:
   100-200 Vokens (randomly)

Users covered expected:
   About 300,000 users.

Significance:
   Promote visibility and consensus in the process of gradual maturity of the Vision Network.

Looking forward to:
   Share, spread and popularize the Vision Network concept, and to let more people know.


.. NOTE::

   We detected organized bulk use of airdrop contracts to receive vokens at a low cost.

   Therefore,
   we decided to temporarily suspend the airdrop contract
   to avoid a large number of low-cost vokens
   entering the market and destroying the ecology.

Voken's pricing logic and early opportunities
=============================================

Just think about one question:

| IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE, THAT
| **YOU CAN PAY $1 FOR A $100 REAL CASH**,
| FIRST COME FIRST SERVED,
| **HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO BUY**?


The first crypto-currency with clear usage value
------------------------------------------------

The vast majority of blockchain networks are just a set of accounting systems.
Those crypto-currencies do not rely on any anchoring or credit to issue,
and their price support comes from the holder's beliefs.

But Voken is quite different.


What is Voken?
______________

**Voken** is the unique token in the Vision Network ecosystem,
which uses Proof of Traffic consensus mechanism.
It is the native asset on the vnCHAIN.


1 Voken = 100GB client traffic flow
___________________________________

**Voken** is the first crypto-currency with clear usage value.

In the underlying code, 1 Voken was defined as the client traffic of 100GBytes,
that is: **1 Voken = 100GB client traffic flow**.



How much does 100GB traffic cost?
---------------------------------

Including the traffic,
the price of all types of network resources can be clearly checked
by major IDC service providers,
which are clearly priced.



The price of resource in an IDC
_______________________________

:ref:`the_price_of_resource_in_an_idc`

For 100GB network traffic, there is a price reference for mature IDC,
with Amazon Web Services AWS, for example, priced at about **$8.50** per 100GB traffic
and Google Cloud Platform GCP at about **$8.0**.

Accelerating traffic is more expensive, while ordinary traffic is cheaper.

   - `AWS CloudFront Pricing`_

GCP Google Cloud Platform:
   - `GCP Interconnect Pricing`_
   - `GCP CDN Pricing`_

Voken price during the Public-Sale: $0.001 - $0.601
---------------------------------------------------

:ref:`incremental_voken_sales_price`

Starting at **1 Voken = $0.001**, until the price reaches **$0.601**.

3 basic principles of the Vision Network
----------------------------------------

There are 3 basic principles in the Vision Network ecosystem:

#. Freedom, equality, openness, sharing, is the basic gene of the Internet,
   communication security and privacy protection are the basic rights of users.
#. Service generates real value.
#. | The user pays, and the service provider charges,
   | **IT IS THE NATURAL TRADING SCENARIO**.

They are the foundation of the project,
the law of value that is non-human resistant,
also our belief:
If these three principles are established,
the value of the entire project will be established, for sure, no doubt it.



Most Voken will be handed over to users
---------------------------------------

74.53% of the Vokens will ultimately be held by users. See: :ref:`distribution_plan`

This is a large ecosystem built by all participants.
The more service nodes and more users, the stronger the network will be.

Incremental sales prices will promote the market price of the entire system,
during the :ref:`voken_sale`,
about **595.13 million USD** (50-100% of all the sales revenue)
will be owned by the community promoters.
